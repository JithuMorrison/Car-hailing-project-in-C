First before the sign in process we have to enter customer or driver next in create or login, you have to enter create to create account and login to login, if you give create enter user name,password, re-enter password, location, phone number, cartype, depending on driver or customer.
Then in login enter user name and password. If both are it takes to next step else it asks for forgot password if yes you can change password else it ends
In the next step, there are eight possible steps for customer and 5 for driver. So enter a number within 1-8 for customer, 1 takes you to booking, here it asks starting location, destination, car preferences, driver preferences, enter everything as your wish and if you give yes for payment it asks for advance booking or not if you give yes it asks for day, date and how much days early, else it goes for onboard booking, if you give yes it gives you onboard payment else direct booking which ends with rating
if you give no for payment, it gets cancelled, if you give two you can see  your payment history, if 3 you can give ratings,4 for seeing ratings, 5 for cancelling,6 for seeing customer details, if given mine your details if all other customer details, if 7 it's car share it has same process as booking nearly, if 8 quits,
Driver has 5, one is for picking customer if you enter yes line number to pick and some details, you can pick the customer, 2 is for see driver ratings, 3 for check ratings, 4 is for seeing customer details if all, can see others, if mine, can see yours.
